# üü° Guilded.NET
</div>

Guilded.NET is a free and open-source unofficial API framework/library for [Guilded](https://guilded.gg/) written on .NET platform. It allows creating bots, webhooks and interacting any other way with Guilded API.

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.8.4-red?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/IdkGoodName/Guilded.NET) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-Beta-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Guilded-NET/Guilded.NET)

## üì• Installing

Guilded.NET is available as a package on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Guilded/) (or [FuGet](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Guilded/)).

You can run this command to add Guilded.NET to an existing .NET project:

```bash
dotnet add package Guilded
```

Otherwise, you can install Guilded.NET templates and create new Guilded.NET projects:

```bash
dotnet new -i Guilded.Templates
dotnet new guilded.bot
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using Guilded.NET

You can check out [Guilded.NET's](https://guilded-net.github.io/docs) guide to get started on your bot. If you want to see everything that Guilded.NET offers, check out [reference page](https://guilded-net.github.io/references).

It is recommended to use .NET 5 or above for Guilded.NET. While Guilded.NET supports .NET Core 3.0 or similar for now, this will change in the kind-of-late future.

## üìô Example

Here's a quick example of Guilded.NET bot with `!ping` command:

```cs
// Program.cs
using System.Reactive.Linq;
using Guilded;

string auth   = "your_bots_auth_token",
       prefix = "!";

await using var client = new GuildedBotClient(auth);

client.Prepared
      .Subscribe(me =>
          Console.WriteLine("The bot is prepared!\nLogged in as \"{0}\" with the ID \"{1}\"", me.Name, me.Id)
      );

// Wait for !ping messages
client.MessageCreated
    .Where(msgCreated => msgCreated.Content == prefix + "ping")
    .Subscribe(async msgCreated =>
        await msgCreated.ReplyAsync("Pong!")
    );

await client.ConnectAsync();

// Don't close the program when the bot connects; not recommended to put code after this
await Task.Delay(-1);
```

(The showcased code uses enabled implicit usings option)

## ‚úÖ Goals

Our goal is to provide a library or a framework that is consistent and fast, while also maintaining friendliness towards the bot developers. API library that does not bite bot developer's hand allows bot developers to focus more on their code, have fun in what they are doing and have easier time creating their bots. Consistency helps code be more predictable, easier to rewrite and waste less time. As such, these 3 points are our main goals while maintaining Guilded.NET.
